## Steps to Open an AWS Account

1. **Visit the Signup AWS Page**  
   Go to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com) and click on the **Create an AWS account** button at the top right corner.

2. **Enter Your Email, AWS account name and Create your password**  
   - Provide your email address.
   - Create an account name (e.g., "My AWS Learning Journey").
   - Click on the "Verify email address" button
   - Security Verification: type the characters as shown and choose submit.
   - Confirm you are you: enter the Verification code sent to the email you provided and choose verify button.
   - Create and confirm your root user password and choose continue

3. **Provide Contact Information**  
   - Select **Personal Account** or **Professional Account**.  
   - Enter your name, address, and phone number.  
   - Accept the AWS terms and conditions and choose continue.

4. **Add Payment Information**

   - AWS will send a verification code to your phone. Enter the code to complete verification.

6. **Select a Support Plan**  
   - Choose the **Basic Plan** (free tier) unless you need advanced support. Choose complete sign up button.

## Notes
- Ensure you use a valid email and phone number.
- Accounts are usually activated within few minutes, but the process might take up to 24 hours.
- You will receive a confirmation email when your account is fully activated. You will have full access all aws services after you receive this email.
- Always monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges.

## Next Step
I plan to explore the AWS Free Tier services and document how I navigate the AWS Management Console.
